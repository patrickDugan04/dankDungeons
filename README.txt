# dankDungeons 2.0 
Hi I am Patrick this is my first game 

-----------------------------------------------------

What You Need 
I recommend you have java 1.8
 you just need the defalt package that comes whith jdk

 
How to run

all you need to do is go into terminal and use cd and ls(if you don'y know what they are done a quick lesson of the command line will only take like 5 min) to go where you downloaded the game

then go into the folder unlil you are in the src folder once in their type javac Main.java than java Main

 
after you are done playing type 5 or die(in game that is)
